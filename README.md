# Notetaker

This thing has been through some iterations. Initially it was a small app inspired very loosely by Obisdian and other note-taking applications. It is not an Obisdian clone or even close to the level of functionality that Obsidian offers.

I built it originally as a Vanilla JS PWA. It worked, but with some weird bugs and issues with state management.

I then tried to rebuild with Svelte, but lost interest.

Now, in 2024 I'm using this app as an opportunity to learn the CMS Design System & relearn React. Note the abuse of the context API.
